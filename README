In this work I draw star-schema defining relation between fact and dimension table following the company process to analyse.

The company:
------------
Brazilian based company which operates hundreds of trucks of different types to collect and transport solid waste. the company would like to create a data warehouse so that it can create reports


I populate the database created in postgreSQL with CSV files published by the company through PgAdmin
I perform some exploratory analysis using SQL queries.



Note : I also connect Data warehouse created with Cognos analytics, consultable via the link: https://eu2.ca.analytics.ibm.com/bi/?perspective=dashboard&pathRef=.my_folders%2FWaste%2Bcollected%2BFinal%2BProject&action=view&mode=dashboard
